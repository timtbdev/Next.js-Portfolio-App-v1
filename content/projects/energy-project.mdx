This website was designed and developed from scratch using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to showcase a renewable energy project. Marketing materials and visuals were created in **Photoshop**, along with videos in **After Effects**. A lot of effort went into highlighting the projectâ€™s benefits and making the content engaging.
